    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I do design, development and research. I make games, websites, and apps. I teach computer science. I also research applied game design in my PhD.</p>

    <p>I have a background in linguistics doing syntactic analysis and formal semantics. In my research I study the design of applied games for scientific data collection. In other words, I get people to talk to games.</p>

    <p>I like explicitly-typed object-oriented languages like C#, Typescript and Java, but I also use Python, Javascript, and whatever else is required. I like to write code that expresses meaning as well as function. I like to find new ways of thinking that achieve complex behaviour without becoming complicated. I also like dependancy injection.</p>
