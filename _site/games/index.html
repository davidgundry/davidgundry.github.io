    <p>I make games.</p>
    <p>Here you will find examples of some of the games I have made, as well as some other projects.</p>

    <h2>Pastry Chefs</h2>
    <p>A game of competative pastry-baking.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>This was originally designed as an <strong>applied game</strong> to get its players to use a particular linguistic structure. It is part of my PhD research into the design of applied games for <strong>data collection</strong>. The challenge of making applied games for data collection is that they need to both be <em>good games</em> and <em>good measurement instruments</em>. If it's not fun to play, it won't have ecological validity, that is, it won't count as a <em>real</em> game.</p>
    <p>Designing an applied game is all about balancing competing requirements and constraints.</p>

    <h2>Pass My Pants</h2>
    <p>Doing laundry has never been so perilous! Avoid getting clothes on the floor in this fast, silly card game.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I led the mechanic design and playtesting for this game, which was made in two days for the Global Game Jam. Card games are a good format for game jams because you can get playtesting and iterating as soon as you have a half-baked idea. Good design comes more from iteration than from inspiration.</p>
    <p>Our guiding intention was to made something cooperative with an importance placed on communication. In fact, by limiting the players ability to communicate to the game mechanics, players must focus more on interpreting what other players are tring to tell them.</p>

    <h2>Go Right and Get Points</h2>
    <p>Swing between platforms, collect the lights, but don't fall into the fog.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>A game about moreish but hollow rewards. Just enough pressure to keep you moving forwards while staying relaxing. A drip feed of rewards. Just enough challenge to require effort, but you respawn straight into the game to give no stopping point. The fog itself just goes on and on.</p>

    <h2>Doctor Allophone's Fantastic Phonetic Flying Machine</h2>
    <p>Doctor Allophone has completed his latest invention - a speech-powered flying machine! But after a mishap, you must take to the controls to recover his lost designs.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I made this game in 24 hours for the Heritige Game Jam run by the National Archives.</p>
    <p>It is developed in Unity for mobile devices. The YIN pitch detection algorithm is adapted to provide speech detection. The device's accelerometer controls left-right movement. A simple procedural content generator provides an endless stream of nonsense inventions, included to give you something to say.</p>
    <p>My goal with this game was to see how providing prompts could make players more likely to use speech input in games.</p>

    <h2>Escape from New Cross</h2>
    <p>You're lost in a maze reminicent of the London Underground being stalked by ghosts. Collect all the dots to escape in this Pacman-like.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I made this game with a collegue in a week at the IGGI Game Development course in London's New Cross.</p>

    <h2>Platform Level Generator</h2>
    <p>Inspired by a game idea and coded in the IGGI Game Development module, this is a Javascript app that generates maze-like 3D platforms.</p>
    <p>Multiple A* agents navigate through space while laying a path behind them.</p>
    <p>Refresh the page to run the generator.</p>

    <h2>Character Sheet Management System</h2>
    <p>I developed a content management system that has been used to manage two live action roleplaying games at the University of York, serving around 60 users. It allows user to access their character sheets and provides support for skill trees and player management.</p>
    <!--<p>I co-ran a small campus LARP with around 20 players. We needed a solution to manage our players' character sheets. Previous LARPs at York had used a similar system, but this was inaccessible. The CSMS also integrated support for downtimes and character skill management, which were significant additional features for helping to manage the game.</p>-->

    <h2>My Personal Website</h2>
    <p>This website has been designed following principles of interaction design, and devloped with a focus on clean code and separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The HTML does what it is designed for: marking up the content expressively. Non-semantic tags and visual/script-only elements are avoided to make it maximally agnostic to the visual design.</p>
    <!--<p>Few sites, if well designed, should require Javascirpt. This website is designed first for non-javascript devices (eg. accesibility devices and printing). The javascript adapts this to provide a user interaction design that cannot be achieved without scripting.</p>-->
