                <h2>Games</h2>
                <p>I make games for <a href="../research/">my research</a>. I make games for fun. I make games because I couldn't not make games. If I was stranded on a desert island, you'd find me on the beach making games out of sand and pebbles.</p>
                <p>Here you will find examples of some of the games I have made</p>

                <h2>Pastry Chefs</h2>
                <p>A game of competative pastry-baking.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>This was originally designed as an <strong>applied game</strong> to get its players to use a particular linguistic structure. It is part of my PhD research into the design of applied games for <strong>data collection</strong>. The challenge of making applied games for data collection is that they need to both be <em>good games</em> and <em>good measurement instruments</em>. If it's not fun to play, it won't have ecological validity, that is, it won't count as a <em>real</em> game.</p>
                <p>Designing an applied game is all about balancing competing requirements and constraints.</p>

                <h2>Pass My Pants</h2>
                <p>Doing laundry has never been so perilous! Avoid getting clothes on the floor in this fast, silly card game.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>I led the mechanic design and playtesting for this game, which was made in two days for the Global Game Jam. Card games are a good format for game jams because you can get playtesting and iterating as soon as you have a half-baked idea. Good design comes more from iteration than from inspiration.</p>
                <p>Our guiding intention was to made something cooperative with an importance placed on communication. In fact, by limiting the players ability to communicate to the game mechanics, players must focus more on interpreting what other players are tring to tell them.</p>
