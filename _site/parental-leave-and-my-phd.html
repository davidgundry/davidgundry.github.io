                <p>I became a parent while persuing my PhD. I have subsequently fallen into a quagmire of administrative uncertainty, primarily over two issues: securing shared parental leave, and switching to part time. These issues took over 18 months to resolve, and have been resolved only at the last possible minute. I think this ongoing uncertainty had far more effect on my mental health than I acnowledged to myself at the time. I joked to a collegue, with regards to my part time application: “So it either happens, or I’m screwed. So really, there’s no point worrying about it.” But I was worrying about it, I had just internalised the notion that there was nothing I could <em>do</em> about it. In retrospect I was stressed, facing a growing anxiety about sending chasing emails, and getting worse at procrastinating with official tasks. Being forced to do things without official sanction made it harder to talk to my supervisor about it.</p>
                
                <p>I will just address the administative issues here and their effects. I have other things to say about my experience parenting while doing a PhD more generally, but for issues of space, that will have to go elsewhere.</p>
                
                <h2 id="shared-parental-leave">Shared Parental Leave</h2>
                
                <p>I took two weeks paternity leave followed by two months shared parental leave. Shared parental leave is a semi-paid leave that must be divided between both parents. As this involves how long each parent will be away from work, both employers need to be involved. Nowhere in the legislation does it deal with studentships, so it is not clear how the law applies in this case. For example, <em>can</em> you even split parental leave between an employed parent and a student parent?</p>
                
                <p>The regulations of the UK Research Council (UKRC) seems to imply that shared parental leave is possible in a way that matches employment legislation. However, this is based on an extension of maternity leave provision to both parents. It addresses the situation of one parent doing a PhD. It does not clearly address how it interacts with external employers or employment legislation. My partner’s employer had no problem with her taking less shared parental leave (after all, it’s less for them to administer). Nor does it matter to me whether the University can claim some of it back from the government. So for practical purposes, the main uncertainty was whether the University will pay and support shared parental leave.</p>
                
                <p>It took <em>one year</em> before my course completion dates were updated, but it is finally clear that they accept it as a leave of absence. While my stipend payments were not interrupted at the time of the leave, I was still left waiting to see whether they would continue past my original completion date. That is, had they paid me for the leave of absence or had I been paid in advance for later stipend payments?</p>
                
                <p>My stipened payments did stop before they should. Evidently, the shared parental leave had not been processed as it should, and now I was left having to demand my money from the University. At this point I was still very unsure what the legal situation was and felt that I had very little leaverage if the University simply refused to pay. They had never previously committed to do so in writing (despite my requests). I had also been told (without evidence, and after my parental leave request) that I was not in fact directly funded by an RCUK funder and thus the regulations would not necessarily apply.</p>
                
                <p>Centres for Doctoral Training (CDT) which offer PhD studentships are funded from multiple sources. A certain number of studentships come from RCUK funding bodies such as the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), by whom I thought I was funded. In order to recieve an RCUK grant, the CDT must secure additional funding, such as from the University and industry partners. These are measured in terms of the number of studentships funded: so many studentships from the EPSRC, so many from the University, and so on. To a certain extent, this is just an accounting fiction. It is always the CDT that funds the student from a combined pot of money. However, there are restrictions on how RCUK money is spent, as it cannot for example be given to students from outside the EU. Other sources of money, on the other hand, can be used to fund students from outside the EU. Thus even if theoretically the source of studentships is always the CDT, there must be at least some different regulations that apply to students notionally funded by RCUK compared to other funding sources. I have not seen clear evidence where shared parental leave falls in this.</p>
                
                <p>In the end the University did pay me for the additional time at the full stipend rate, evidently accepting that I was able to take shared parental leave, at least as far as they were concerned. However, this final reassurance came over <em>18 months</em> after I was originally arranging my shared parental leave. This delay left me in uncertainty for a long time.</p>
                
                <p>The uncertainty in what I was entitled to effectively cost me the option of taking more leave. While I was paid for the time that I took on shared parental leave, I was effectively denied the chance to take additional chunks of paternity leave (to which one can usually arrange, and I believe I would have been entitled to based on the RCUK regulations). I was hesitant to take large chunks of potentially unpaid leave which could potentially cut months of my PhD time. If we had prompt feedback - at least within the time that employment law demands, which is 8 weeks - we would likely have ended up redistributing the leave again, I would have taken more of it (and been paid my stipend), and my partner would have taken less, as we had decided during my parental leave that she would not return to work afterwards anyway. So it cost us, say, 4 months of time at full pay that I could have spent raising my child.</p>
                
                <p>The uncertainty in waiting for this to be resolved was a long-running source of stress, and I was unable to get an certainty. There were no clear regulations I could look to to understand the situation myself. The University didn’t itself have regulations on shared parental leave (and as far as I know, still doesn’t). This is because the law introducing it is fairly recent, and they apparently had not had a case yet. It seemed likely that a lot of the delay and uncertainty on my end was because the University didn’t know what to do. The bureaucracy means that decisions need to wait until a policy has been determined, and this beauocracy is evidently far too slow moving. Of course this also means I cannot check what I am entitled to.</p>
                
                <p>While usually, the shared parental leave legislation would provide some certainty, or at least a guaranteed base line, even that is far from clear in this case because technically, I am not employed. As a student, I am paid a tax-free stipend which does not conform to the same regulations as employment. So while RCUK have stuck closely to the legislation when drawing up their policy, I cannot rely on the legislation in the way an employee can. Finally, the RCUK regulations seem to me to be unclear and certaintly do not properly explain this situation. They are not drafted to be understood by students, and they do not adequately explain the issue of multiple funding sources with different regulations.</p>
                
                <p>Because I got no official response from the University about my entitlement, I had to trust the interpretation of one administrator. But was I going to hold her responsible for the money if the University refused to pay me? Probably not.</p>
                
                <h2 id="part-time">Part Time</h2>
                
                <p>Approaching a year ago now, I applied to change my mode of registration from full time to part time. I was never sent an acnowedlgement or response. In subsentualy chasing this I have recently found out that my mode of registration <em>has</em> changed, or at least it has on one of the University systems that is hidden from me. What I do know is that it has not changed on any of the student-facing information portals, including those that email me demands to register my meetings and submit my milestones.</p>
                
                <p>Unsurprisingly, I was forced to go part time in practice, despite for a long time not knowing whether I was allowed to. The reasons that I switched to part time obviously could not wait for the University’s convenience. This means that for that length of time, I had been working part time, while thinking I was officially registered as full time. The University’s website makes explicit that until a mode change application recieves a response, a student should not switch to part time working. Yet clearly the mechanisms for responding to a mode change application failed or were overlooked in my case. This was therefore another looming existential threat, where an administrative decision could effectively prevent me from completing my PhD.</p>
                
                <p>Each programme of study, including each PhD programme at the University needs to be passed by the Board of Studies. This must includes each available variant of the programme for different modes of registration. The PhD programme I am on was never designed with a part time option. Therefore there was no part time programme that I could switch to. Switching to part time required a part time version of my PhD programme to be passed by the Board of Studies, presumably before I could switch onto it. This, aside from being a fairly glaring omission from the perspective of accessibility and discrimination, means that I was given more reason for worrying that my part time application would be refused or delayed, and thus either I should have been working more than I was, or I would lose significant time in my PhD.</p>
                
                <p>For a long time my supervisor adhered to the University expectation that you shouldn’t switch to part time until your application is accepted. This meant that I was feeling like I should be working and pretending to be working more than I could. I was juggling two plans for completing my PhD: with and without part time, the fake plan and the real plan.</p>
                
                <h2 id="support">Support</h2>
                
                <p>The reason I believe that one of the reasons these issues took so long to resolve is that the CDT administartor didn’t have the time or space to resolve them sooner. Because of other pressures, it was not treated as a priority and so could be left until the last minute. I could only pressure the administrator, but they needed to have the time to pass that pressure on to different parts of the university structure. They had to be able to track down what was happening without being overwhelmed with other tasks.</p>
                
                <p>The CDT that I am in secured funding as part of the funding bid for a full time administrator to manage the programme, with other part time adminsitrators at the other sites. At the beginning the level of support was good. They were wonderfully helpful back when I was originally applying for shared parental leave. I think that this level of support was essential for me being able to take shared parental leave. However, the support has now largely dissapeared. There are other administators in the Department. I have now switched to addressing all queries to these, but for a long time I felt that the CDT administrator was the person to whom I should be addressing queries.</p>
                
                <p>A new grant was secured supporting a new group of research positions in an area loosely connected with the CDT. The CDT administrator is now line-managed by a manager of this other group. They have even moved office away from the student offices to the other side of the building to be closer to this other group. From the outside it appears that a significant proportion of their work is involved in working on and applying for other projects, despite being paid for out of the CDT grant. Therefore the students are recieving less administrative support than was allocated in the CDT funding bid. In other words, work time appears to be effectively being channeled out of funding bids that have been secured and used to apply for new sources of funding.</p>
                
                <p>The CDT has always suffered from an unacceptable Bus Factor – that is, the organisational risk from a single person being suddenly unable to work. From the beginning it has always been one administrator keeping the CDT running. This has started to be a problem with illness. And with that one administrator absent, things can simply halt.</p>
                
                <p>The CDT’s response to complaints about non-responsiveness has been to strongly discourage us from contacting the administrators at all. They have instead advised us to find information on the University website and through peer support. This is not helpful where knowledge of the workings of the University systems and expectations is required. This true for leaves of absence, shared parental leave, and changes of mode of registration. These are things which are granted not based on formal requirements that can be enumerated on a website but by the interpretation of a committee. Disouraging contacting the administator has been spectacularly unhelpful in my feeling like I could get my issue resolved.</p>
                
                <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
                
                <p>There are further issues with regards to access and discrimination that I don’t have space to go into here. However, in brief, access in general (e.g. for disabled and unwell students), and access for parents (crucial for gender equality regardless of the gender of the parent), requires dealing with issues that are not the norm for most students. For example, just because a shared parental leave policy hasn’t been used yet doesn’t mean one isn’t needed. Dealing with access issues also requies that there be administators that can be contacted, not replaced with peer-support and the University web-pages, because other students do not necessarily have the same issues. It also requres that there is time for these issues to be resolved, and a prioritisation by administrators of students’ needs over chasing new sources of funding.</p>
